## Government Enterprise Architecture Frameworks(GEAFs)

The GEA Framework is the enterprise architecture framework that assists the delivery of consistent and cohesive services to the citizens and facilitate them with digital services in an efficient manner. 

The  GEA  framework  has  been  elaborated  in  seven  documents  corresponding  to  each  of  the above  seven  dimensions. Thehorizontal  layers  in  the  GEA  frameworkrepresenting  the  four dimensions i.e. Business, Information, Application and Infrastructure, form the core of the GEA framework and each of thesefour dimensions have three key elements:

1. Architecture: This section provides conceptual view of the architectural components andcapabilities for each dimension depicting relationships between the dimensional architecturalcomponents.
2. Standards:  This  section  provides  relevant  standards  for  each  of  the  dimensions  with  each  standard categorized for compliance purpose as either mandatory, recommended or optional.
3. Taxonomy:  This  section  provides  reference  taxonomies  for  each  of  the  four  dimensions  to  group enterprise  assets  in  logical  categories  and  describe their architectural  interrelationships.  The  aim  is  to ensure use of common architectural language and identify opportunities for reuse.  

It provides the framework that carries out the following tasks.

- Provides  a common language:providesa common language for agencies involved in the delivery of cross-agency services
- Enhancescollaboration: supportsthe identification of re-usable and sharable services and applications
- Assistsin describing and analyzing IT investments: providesa basis for the objective review of investment by government
- Assistsin transforming Government: enablesmore efficient and timely delivery of e-Services through a repository of standards, principles and templates that assist in the design and delivery ofICT capability and, in turn, business services to citizens

The value of reference models comes from applying them as part of business as usual activities across agencies in a consistent manner. They are used to provide a consistent view across a complex  system  of  Government  business  services  and  supporting  ICT  services  so  that  the delivery  of  government  services  can  become  customer  centric,  and  that  investments  can  be made  that  benefits  the  system  as  a  whole,  not  just  specific  agencies.The  following  guiding principles are used while creating the GEAreference models and other artifacts.

- Customer centricity: Customer insights must inform service selection, design and delivery. Customers should be shielded from the internal complexities of Government
- Promote reuse:Remove fragmentation, duplication and promote consolidation and reuse of shared capabilities
- Share Information bydefault:Informationmust be shared by default rather than by exception
- Enable  co-creationthrough  a  collaborative  environment: Next  generation  of  digital services delivery should facilitate co-creation of digital services on a shared technology platformincluding multiple agencies, 3rdparty service providers and vendors
- Trust and confidence:Build public trust and confidence in governmentâ€™s ability to maintain the privacy and security of information
- Interoperable: Design services for interoperability using applicable standards so that systems can work together to deliver more integrated servicesthrough a common data exchange platform
- Design  for  future:Prepare  Government  services  for  disruptive  technologies  and  emerging trends
